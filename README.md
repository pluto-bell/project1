# About This Project
This is a self-directed project in which I re-created the design/layout and functioning of a website I personally liked.
---> --->  www.https://www.aviv-katz.com/

I did the entire project wth _nearly_ no looking at the original code.

Occasions where I did look at the code were: to find exact colors, occasionally look at width and/or height of an object, occasionally look at how many columns and/or rows were in a grid, and realizing SVGs were being used after attempting to re-create images in pure CSS. 

## What Did I learn?
Major take aways: getting more familiar with React and creating SVGs for the first time, via inkspace. 
Other take aways: more familiarity with grid, and general CSS styling, getting reacquinted with code after taking a break.

## What To Do Now?
This project is by no means perfect. There are a lot of redundancies in my code——meaning it is not very DRY——, I'm still getting familiar with React at this time, and the organization of the code is something to be revamped. At a certain part of tthe process of this project, I realized I didn't want to get bogged down with making everything perfect; instead, taking what I've learned from this project, into my next one. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
